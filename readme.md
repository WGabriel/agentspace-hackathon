# Google Gemini Enterprise, ADK & MCP Hackathon 🚀

Welcome to our hands-on hackathon dedicated to exploring and building with Google's powerful agent development tools: **Gemini Enterprise**, the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, and **Multi-agent Control Plane (MCP)**.

This repository contains the agenda and resources for our session. Throughout the day, you'll participate in four guided labs and a final group brainstorming exercise to apply your new skills.

## 🧠 Group Exercise: Brainstorming

To conclude the day, you will form groups and brainstorm a practical application for the technologies covered.

**Your Goal:**

* Identify a use case within your company where agent technology could be applied.
* Consider how this solution could**reduce expenses** or**increase revenue**.
* Prepare a brief pitch. Consider creating a [one-slider](https://docs.google.com/presentation) outlining your idea with a few bullet points. Each group will select one person to present the idea to everyone.

Happy building!
