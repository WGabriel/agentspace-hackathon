## üß† Group Exercise: Brainstorming

To conclude the day, you will form groups and brainstorm a practical application for the technologies covered.

**Your Goal:**
* Identify a use case within your company where agent technology could be applied.

* Prepare a brief pitch. Each group will select one person to present the idea to everyone.

Happy building!
