## 🧠 Group Exercise: Brainstorming

To conclude the day, you will form groups and brainstorm a practical application for the technologies covered.

**Your Goal:**
* Identify a use case within your company where agent technology could be applied.
* Consider how this solution could **reduce expenses** or **increase revenue**.
* Prepare a brief pitch. Consider creating a [one-slider](https://docs.google.com/presentation) outlining your idea with a few bullet points. Each group will select one person to present the idea to everyone.

Happy building!
