### A Quick Guide to Instructions Syntax used in this Hackathon
To make it clear where each piece of code belongs, we'll use emojis as a guide throughout this workshop:

- **👉 Action Step:** When you see the pointing finger, it marks the beginning of an instruction you need to follow.
- **👀 Observe / FYI:** When you see the eyes, it means you should observe the information provided, such as expected terminal output, a log snippet, or a JSON structure for reference. Do not copy or run this content.
- **📝 In the Editor:** When you see this emoji, it means the code block should be copied and pasted into the specified file within the Editor.
- **💻 In the Terminal:** When you see this emoji, it means the command should be run in the Terminal.
