Please follow the instructions here: [https://codelabs.developers.google.com/devsite/codelabs/build-agents-with-adk-foundation#0](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/devsite/codelabs/build-agents-with-adk-foundation#0)

You can skip creating a Google Cloud project in Step 3 as the project has already been created for you. 

You can also skip the last step (Cleanup) as the environment will be auto-purged after the event.
